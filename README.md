Software defined radio in PureData

The repository is in active development and will change for no reason in particular. The project is sponsored by http://newblankets.org . We are very grateful for their collaboration and support.

If you are interested in development please contact me: tkzic@megalink.net - We are particularly interested in hardware support for low-cost devices, running pdSDR on various platforms, and of course making better radios.

What is this?

Here's a video of the basicSDR3.pd patch running with a soft66LC2 SDR: http://youtu.be/6sH6-DTU14E

Patches are running PdExtended 0.43-4 on MacOS. Although you will probably find you can get it run in Pd vanilla with tweaks.

The project is based on tutorial patches for the Max/MSP SDR project at: http://zerokidz.com/radio - They are well documented at that site.

Externals: The source code and makefiles for hardware support are kind of a disaster. Please don't ask how to compile.  We just figured out how to make this run in Pd a few days ago.
